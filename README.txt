=============================================

Copyright (c) 2011 Pierre de Buyl 

pyMPCD is a package to perform hydrodynamical simulation with the particle-based
MPCD algorithm. pyMPCD requires the NumPy library

pyMPCD is developed by Pierre de Buyl and is available under the `GNU General

Requirements
============

* `Python <http://python.org/>`_.
* The `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ library.
* A Fortran 90 compiler that is enabled by `F2py <http://www.scipy.org/F2py>`_.

Installation
============

From the pyMPCD archive, type ::

    python setup.py install

at a command prompt, with an optional ``--prefix`` argument specifying the
location of installation.

Usage
=====

A simple example of script is found the the ``examples`` directory. After proper
installation it is run by typing ::

    python simple_example.py

at a command prompt.

Documentation
=============

The documentation is provided at pyMPCD's `homepage
<http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~pdebuyl/pympcd/>`_ where one can find a full
doxygen-generated API documentation. The documentation can also be generated by
executing `doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html>`_ in the
``doc`` directory, with the ``doxy_conf`` argument.
